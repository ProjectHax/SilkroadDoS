SilkroadDoS - vSRO Servers

(C++) This exploit works by sending packets with a null opcode into the GatewayServer/AgentServer after completing the handshake process. When the server receives the packets it displays an error message saying it has an unhandled opcode. By spamming the server these messages are written to the log thousands of times until no memory is left and then the server dies.

(Ruby) The next method is to spam the server with tons of connections and send an opcode before the handshake completes. Although less effective, this also creates tons of messages in the log and will eventually kill the server.

Requirements:
VC++ 2010 / Linux gcc
Boost (random.hpp)
Ruby
